TYPE OF DATA STRUCTURES

Physical; how the memory should be organized
1. Array; size is static, can be created in stack, heap
2. Linked list; linked to next node, has variable length, created in heap

Logical; are implemented using physical data structure

linear
1. stack
2. queues
non-linear
3. tress 
4. graph
tabular
5. hash table
 
 ABSTRACT DATATYPE (ADT)
 1. representation of data
 2. operation on data

RECURSION //function calling itself
void fun1(int n)
{
    if(n>0)
    {
        fun1(n-1;)
        print("%d",n); //the output is 1,2,3. Every function call rturns to its calling point
        
    }
}
void main()
{
    int x=3;
    fun1(x); 
}
